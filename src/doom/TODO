Every use of:

create_struct is only used in textscreen, in theory everything could be moved to new/delete in there

zmalloc all gone src/doom grep zmalloc *
Z_Malloc all gone
malloc  all gone from src/doom grep malloc * | grep -v zone_malloc

calloc => ZI, only zone_calloc remains
realloc => std::vector, all gone!

 and all variants of free
memcmp also suspicous =>std::equal, all gone from src/doom
memcpy
memset ( move to zone_calloc where possible, also add a create_struct version, or default init or std::fill )
mommove gone from src/doom, just networking ones left.

any c-style cast" "-Wold-style-cast" in `/githug/cpp-doom/CMakeLists.txt
