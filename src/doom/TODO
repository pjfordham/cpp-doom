Every use of:

create_struct is only used in textscreen, in theory everything could be moved to new/delete in there

Zone Allocator: properly implement this for deletes

zone_malloc
zone_calloc
and Z_Free


zmalloc all gone
Z_Malloc all gone
calloc => all_gone
realloc => all gone!

malloc  all gone from src/doom grep malloc * | grep -v zone_malloc ALL GONE!
and all variants of free, single free left in src/doom paired locally with strdup ALL GONE!

All string manipulation to std::string and stringview with M_StringDuplicate for compat

Remove M_StringDuplicate/free and replace with string or unique_ptr<char[]>

memcmp => std::equal, all gone
memcpy => std::copy

memset => std::fill or default init {}

mommove gone from src/doom, just networking ones left.

examine sector_t::specialdata void*, std::variant is awkward

fix savegame restoration of thinker pointers, save gets 1 or 0 if the pointer is set or not. -1 is delete, 0 is NOOP, 1 is set to the function. Do this better.

maintain list of thinkers in order added to lists to keep demo's working.

do savegame fixes to virtualized thnkers.

now thinkers are in wrong order anyway  we can probably move from std::list to std::Vector

Also consider emplace allocation for thinkers.

any c-style cast" "-Wold-style-cast" in `/githug/cpp-doom/CMakeLists.txt
any void*

remove dynamic_Cast from p_extsaveg.cpp

review all uses of c_str
review all use of taking std::string as a parameter with a view to using std::string_view
